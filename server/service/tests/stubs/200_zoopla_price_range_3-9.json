The former White Lion was the first stop on the stagecoach route from London to Portsmouth and, whilst the elevations are mainly 18th century, parts of this historic building date back to the 16th century.The 24 newly built homes, set in three buildings – Barley House, Mackay House and The Malthouse include a collection of two, three and four-bedroom apartments and duplexes along with a three-bedroom house. Each unique new home provides plenty of generously-proportioned living space and all have outside space in the form of private gardens, terraces, balconies, Juliette balconies or roof terraces. All the stylish, energy-efficient homes at White Lion Place have been designed to reflect the grandeur of the listed building and historical relevance of the site and each features the contemporary, high quality specification that is a hallmark of all Beechcroft properties.",

            "description": "This beautifully refurbished home can be found on a private road that leads to the footpaths and trails that meander through the South Foreland Valley, a protected area of Special Scientific Interest around St. Margaret’s Bay, so is very quiet and peaceful. From the moment you walk through the front door into the very spacious and welcoming entrance hall, you will be mesmerised by the view. Whether you rush straight outside through one of the two sets of French doors onto the terrace to get a better look or wander through the bevelled glass doors into the light and elegant lounge with its two sets of French doors leading directly onto the terrace, bookshelves (handmade by Thoroughly Wood) and attractive fireplace, it is still the view across the countryside, white cliffs and the sea that takes your breath away. At night, in the winter, the clear skies make it an excellent spot for anyone interested in astronomy. There is a delightful open-plan feel about this lovely home as you flow through from the hall to the dining room and the sitting area to the modern bespoke kitchen and breakfast area designed by City Kitchens of Canterbury. It includes a built-in double oven, microwave and hob, integrated Miele dishwasher, fridge, freezer and washing machine while the large breakfast area also has double French doors to the terrace so you can sit here and enjoy the great outdoors. There is a large study overlooking the gardens, as well as a separate bedroom and bathroom accessed through glass doors. As the older ‘cottage’ part of the house was built at the turn of the last century and the newer extension was added circa 2002, the house has two staircases. The first leads to the master bedroom with its wall of mirrored and wood wardrobes, modern bathroom with bath, power shower and underfloor heating, as well as two superb balconies where you can sit over your morning coffee admiring the view or enjoy a nightcap watching the twinkling lights of Calais. Another double bedroom and bathroom up the second staircase provides guests or family members with their own private, en suite facilities.What the Owner says:We have lived in our lovely home for the past 10 years and spent a year completely remodelling it. Our aim has been to create a wonderful place to live, with the emphasis on a light and airy environment where most of the windows and the six sets of French doors look out onto the magnificent views of the Channel and South Foreland Valley. We wanted to make a home andnot just refurbish a house, and hope the next owners will be able to enjoy it as much as we have – whether they are looking for a permanent home or a lovely weekend and holiday retreat. St. Margaret’s is a very community-spirited village and has been home to a number of well-known celebrities. Peter Ustinov bought a small military building on the clifftop. Noel Coward owned White Cliffs, which he subsequently sold to Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond. It is thought that Ian Fleming based his character James Bond’s code name 007 on the bus service which ran from Deal to London. There are two hotels and two public houses as well as a post office, village shop and a regular bus service to Dover, Deal and Canterbury and a wide range of societies and clubs. Residents are also able to use the St. Margaret’s resort, making use of the gym, sauna and swimming pool. You will find plenty of wonderful walks from virtually outside the front door to Kingsdown, the Dover Patrol Memorial and the SouthForeland Lighthouse – the first in the world with electric light.

            "description": "An imposing and substantial attached Grade II listed period home centrally located in Balls Green, in between the market towns of Nailsworth & Minchinhampton. The present owners have lovingly restored this important local residence. Their aim was to renovate the period features at the same time as upgrading the facilities to a higher and more comfortable standard. The various works carried out have helped to create a fabulous family home. The official listing dates the property to the early 19th Century. Even though Balls Green House is attached to its neighbour, it very much feels like a detached property. As you will see from the floor plan, the layout of the comprehensive accommodation is found over four levels with a central staircase. Upon entering the property, you are met with a beautiful entrance hall with access to both of the principal reception rooms and the kitchen. The drawing room benefits from access out to the garden. On the lower ground floor you will find a 29' basement/games room with access to a utility room, a study and a useful store room. You can also access the garden from this floor. The bedrooms are located on the first and second floors. Bedrooms one and two enjoy a 'Jack and Jill' bathroom. On the second floor you will find two further bedrooms and a bathroom, with two more bedrooms accessed by separate staircases. Two further rooms offer extra living space with one room leading out to the rear garden. Property Ref: STR150246.SituationBalls Green is a small collection of homes lying in an elevated rural position just outside Minchinhampton. Minchinhampton has a range of independent amenities including a delicatessen, butcher, chemist, cafés, tea room, restaurant, an organic dairy, a useful small supermarket, doctors’ surgery, library, primary school, two churches and further facilities. The property is situated on an escarpment position enjoying beautiful views over the surrounding Cotswold valley. The house faces south west and the garden enjoys the afternoon sun. The nearby market town of Nailsworth offers a wider selection of shops, bars and amenities with both Stroud and Cirencester also being within reach. The communication links are also excellent with Stroud and Kemble Stations offering high-speed train links to London Paddington in under 90 minutes and the A419 linking through to the M4 either at Junction 18 for Bath or Junction 17 for Malmesbury. Schooling is also a big pull for this area with both Wycliffe College and Beaudesert Park School being popular choices for local families. The area also has two grammar schools, and Minchinhampton itself offers excellent primary education.OutsideThe gardens are situated to the side and rear of the property. A shared driveway leads past the neighbouring property up to a private gravelled parking area, offering parking for several vehicles. The property contains a detached garage with a substantial store room above. The extensive grounds are quite exceptional & will be any gardener’s dream. Mainly laid to lawn with an abundance of trees, shrubs, roses & hedging, the majority of the garden is completely private and is partly enclosed by Cotswold stone walls. The garden enjoys views over a neighbouring field, which is owned and managed by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust.",

            "description": "St George Wharf is a landmark riverside development spanning across 7 acres of London's hottest area of regeneration, and conveniently, just moments from London's Vauxhall Underground Station. Initially rising 22 storeys but now with the addition of the 48 storey Tower, the tallest sole residential building in the UK, St George Wharf is a focal point of the South Bank. The main development is easily identifiable by its gull-wing roofs and stylish terraces; Broadway Malyan Architects had a willingness to champion innovation and as such have designed an original and expressive building with a fantastic attention to detail. Riverside living does not get much better than this.Residents of this SW8 development, St George Wharf, often comment on its sense of community, with a stunning series of landscaped courtyards and elegant fountains creating an idyllic rural atmosphere in the heart of central London. St George Wharf combines this serene courtyard with state of the art facilities; amenities include a supermarket, restaurant and bar, an nhs Doctors, dentist, a 24hr gymnasium and a spa offering a wide variety of treatments.In keeping with the green ethos of the development, the newly completed Tower will require one third of the energy currently used by similar buildings. Specifically, One, The Tower will house a wind turbine to power common lighting areas and a London Aquifer (complete with heat pump technology) to extract warmth from water to heat apartments during the winter. Triple-glazed windows throughout minimise heat loss in winter whilst ventilated blinds between the glazing protects apartments from heat through direct sunlight.Not only is St George Wharf a peaceful environment in the heart of the capital, it's also a safe one. With apartments accessible to a 24 hour concierge service, CCTV and a video entry system into each property, safety and security in the development was paramount in the developer's approach.Apartments vary from studios to luxury 5 bedroom penthouses, all finished to the highest specification. The breath-taking river views and fantastic transport links ensure St George Wharf is the best of both worlds in terms of luxury and necessity. With Vauxhall Underground Station right on your doorstep Victoria, Green Park and Oxford Circus stations are all just minutes away. The nearby Vauxhall Rail Station means areas such as Waterloo and Clapham Junction are also easily accessible.",

Unique in design with a tiled 'Gambrel' roof, with low sloping eaves, the property has many of the original features in keeping with the period, whilst having been sympathetically modernised and extended by the present owners. The fabulous hallway is finished in oak panelling with a solid oak 'open tread' staircase to the first floor. A second identical staircase continues from the landing to the top floor, which comprises two bright, sizable double bedrooms. On the ground floor, there are two generous reception rooms, a guest toilet and a fitted kitchen. The main reception room has a lovely integrated double glazed conservatory extension, with views over the garden. On the first floor are three double bedrooms, the main one with fitted furniture, and a large family bathroom. The garden is stocked with assorted flowers and shrubs surrounding a well-tended lawn, enclosed by timber fencing. There is a garage with its own driveway to the side. A very pleasant location on a quiet road, only a short walk from the delightful Friary Park and North Middlesex Golf Course, with good transport connections, popular local schools and an array of shops, eateries and restaurants available on North Finchley High Road.",
