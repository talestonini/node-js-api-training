            "description": "A substantial and attractive 1930’s built family home which has been successfully extended, remodelled and improved, now offering very adaptable three storey accommodation. Due to specific circumstances the house has been extended to accommodate two families and is therefore slightly unusual.Currently, there is an impressive kitchen/dining/living room and adjacent to that is a second kitchen/dining/family room with two bedrooms and bathroom which is being used as a self-contained annexe. Alternatively, a quick glance at the floorplan will demonstrate that this area could be utilised differently. The kitchen could be removed and the room become the principal living room with the ground floor bedrooms used as reception rooms, as required. The rear extension has attractive ceiling lanterns in two of the rooms which provide excellent natural light and bi-fold doors open to the rear decking from the family area, living room and main ground floor bedroom.The first floor has a useful study area currently operating as an office with workstation, plus there are two bedrooms and shower room. The second floor has been converted into the master bedroom with twin wardrobe cupboards, stylish en-suite bathroom and there is a Juliet balcony. The house is superbly presented with fresh and modern décor, stylish contemporary bath/shower rooms (with rainhead showers, double cubicles and a free-standing bath to the en-suite bathroom) and kitchens which is balanced with some original features such as leaded light windows, although the extended rooms have double glazed leaded lights units.The main kitchen features numerous integrated appliances, induction hob, Corian worktops and high gloss units. There are also large porcelain tiles throughout the kitchen/dining/living room and the second kitchen/family room and off the main kitchen is a utility/boot room.Crystal chandeliers in all the main reception areas plus some rooms feature chrome downlighters and every room has chrome sockets, switches etc.Outside, is an adjacent garage, ample off road parking on a shingle driveway, whilst the substantial rear garden has a large timber decking, pergola, shed and lawn.The location is hugely convenient being within a half mile radius to Woking centre and station.Woking has a thriving town centre offering extensive shopping, dining and leisure facilities including The New Victoria Theatre & Cinema, and the Lightbox Gallery.

To the first floor there is a double bedroom with additional children's bedroom/dressing room off, further double bedroom with long distance views and large master bedroom which is currently used as living area.

The foundations on the original hall (Carr House) were taken from the old Kirklees Priory, which stood only 100 meters from the hall, and was demolished by Cromwell during the Protestant/Catholic turmoil. There is evidence that Charlotte Bronte frequently visited Kirklees Hall, and the hall is mentioned in some of her books. In the grounds of Kirklees Hall estate is the grave of Robin Hood. It is said that his Aunt was the prioress of the priory and was known for her healing powers by way of blood letting.",

            "letting_fees": "When renting a property with Currell, please be aware that fees will apply during the process. Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge £240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are £40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and £50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from £108 (including VAT) to £240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.",

Perhaps the overwhelming theme of the property is the outlook and access onto the surrounding private garden area.The stunning kitchen has a range of high gloss black contemporary fitted units with a quartz work surface and integrated Neff appliances. The breakfast room/family room benefits from retractable doors which lead to the south facing patio area.There are three formal living room areas and a grand formal dining room.A fabulous feature of the drawing room is an original fully working character fireplace with inset marble back and slate hearth. This room also benefits from retractable bi-fold doors which lead to the side patio area.The formal dining room has a log burner effect gas fire which utilises steam as smoke and retractablebi-fold doors leading to the landscaped gardens.The master bedroom has a garden outlook and direct access to a west facing patio. It also benefitsfrom a fabulous en-suite, separate wet room and WC.There are three guest bedrooms, all of which are good size rooms and all benefit from luxurious en-suite facilities.Externally the property benefits from a simply fabulous garden area which has various access points. The main body of the garden is laid to lawn and is positioned to the south and south easterly sides of the property. The manicured lawns have exceptionally well stocked flower, tree and mature shrub borders. A computerised fully automated irrigation system ensures that the garden is fairly low maintenance.

The apartment has been newly renovated and refurbished to what is, in our opinion, the highest of standards and sits in 0.5 acres of beautifully landscaped irrigated gardens that boast sumptuous lawns, floral borders, mature shrubbery and beautiful established trees.  The town centres of Bournemouth and Westbourne providing superb restaurant, entertainment and shopping facilities are within one mile in either direction and the famous cliff tops with their famous Chines and pathways leading down to the award winning beaches are only a short walk of a few hundred metres.  The property benefits from the original grand entrance to the building and incorporates versatile accommodation as detailed on the attached floor plan.  There are an exceptional number of outstanding features to the property, too numerous to list individually. Perhaps the overwhelming theme of the property is the outlook and access onto the surrounding private garden area.  The stunning kitchen has a range of high gloss black contemporary fitted units with a quartz work surface and integrated Neff appliances. The breakfast room/family room benefits from retractable doors which lead to the south facing patio area.  There are three formal living room areas and a grand formal dining room.  A fabulous feature of the drawing room is an original fully working character fireplace with inset marble back and slate hearth. This room also benefits from retractable bi-fold doors which lead to the side patio area.  The formal dining room has a log burner effect gas fire which utilises steam as smoke and retractable bi-fold doors leading to the landscaped gardens.  The master bedroom has a garden outlook and direct access to a west facing patio. It also benefits from a fabulous en-suite, separate wet room and WC.  There are three guest bedrooms, all of which are good size rooms and all benefit from luxurious en-suite facilities.  Externally the property benefits from a simply fabulous garden area which has various access points. The main body of the garden is laid to lawn and is positioned to the south and south easterly sides of the property. The manicured lawns have exceptionally well stocked flower, tree and mature shrub borders. A computerised fully automated irrigation system ensures that the garden is fairly low maintenance. A private footpath gives access to the West Overcliff which in turn leads down to the local safe and sandy beaches at Alum Chine.  Two main features of the garden are a heated outdoor swimming pool and a bespoke built summer house with timber tiled roof and seating for up to 12 people with power and light, ideal for al fresco dining.  A garage with an electrically operated up and over door and two allocated parking spaces are conveyed with apartment. ",

            "description": "This highly individual apartment occupies the ground floor at Westray Hall, benefiting from a private front door. It is also conveyed with the major portion of the rear garden, forming a beautiful and highly impressive setting for the mansion-style living accommodation. The reception hall opens onto an informal reception / sitting area and the formal sitting room is perfect for entertaining with doors opening onto a rear sun terrace and an extremely well concealed cinema system, incorporating a remote control drop down cinema projector and a motorised screen above the period fireplace. There are four en-suite bedrooms, the master being the most impressive with a sumptuous bathroom and doors opening onto a rear sun terrace.The remaining accommodation includes a contemporary fitted kitchen, informal dining and an additional feature split-level dining room with a vaulted ceiling and a conservatory. The fixtures and fittings have been the subject of a no-expense-spared fit out by one of the area's leading interior designers, although many of the fine period features have been retained. The style of the apartment is undoubtedly one of grandeur with high ceilings, deep skirtings, moulded architraves pediments over many doors all of which are skillfully combined with mod cons such as an integrated sound system with concealed ceiling speakers by local specialists Dawsons.SituationThe West Cliff Conservation Area is one of the most exclusive enclaves of Bournemouth. It retains much of its Edwardian charm and the cliff top sea views, zig-zags and chines remain part of its attraction. The shopping centres of Bournemouth and Westbourne are nearby and the well-known Sandbanks Peninsula is only a short drive away. The larger area is home to a number of health spas and golf clubs and Poole Harbour is a mecca for watersports enthusiasts and is also home to a number of yacht clubs.OutsideThe grounds are something of a one-off and they are privately maintained by the current owners although there is an automatic irrigation system. The overall effect is very pleasing and there is a rather attractive ornamental oak which is though to have some age. Unusually, the grounds include a private swimming pool and a pavilion, which benefits from patio heaters and piped music. There is a single garage near to the entrance of the apartment with extra demised space for visitor and casual parking.",

            "description": "  This unique property, which sits on Edwardian brick arches, overlooks its own private riverside garden and pontoon. On the other side of the river is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a working dairy farm.Until c.1950 the house was occupied by the Wallingford ferryman, who transported horses, people and freight across the river at the point where the River Thames tow path changed sides. The raised outhouse was the ticket booth associated with the ferry.The house is on the southern edge of the pretty medieval market town of Wallingford, situated along the banks of the River Thames. The centre of the town is a five minute walk along either the riverside or quiet roads, and has a picturesque town square with a 17th century arcaded town hall, a number of historic inns and restaurants, three ancient churches, the Corn Exchange theatre and cinema, a large Waitrose and a summer outdoor swimming pool.Just over an hour's drive from London, 15 minutes from Henley and 20 minutes from Oxford. Enjoy the Cholsey and Wallingford Steam Railway, or a walk around the ruins of Wallingford Castle, once one of the largest in the country but largely destroyed by Oliver Cromwell. There is a town museum in Wallingford and Agatha Christie's home and boathouse nearby. Nearby places include Silverstone, Towester Racecourse and Stowe Gardens. Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill and the spectacular city of Oxford are in close proximity.",
