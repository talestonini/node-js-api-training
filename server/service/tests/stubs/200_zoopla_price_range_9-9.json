            "description": "  This unique property, which sits on Edwardian brick arches, overlooks its own private riverside garden and pontoon. On the other side of the river is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a working dairy farm.Until c.1950 the house was occupied by the Wallingford ferryman, who transported horses, people and freight across the river at the point where the River Thames tow path changed sides. The raised outhouse was the ticket booth associated with the ferry.The house is on the southern edge of the pretty medieval market town of Wallingford, situated along the banks of the River Thames. The centre of the town is a five minute walk along either the riverside or quiet roads, and has a picturesque town square with a 17th century arcaded town hall, a number of historic inns and restaurants, three ancient churches, the Corn Exchange theatre and cinema, a large Waitrose and a summer outdoor swimming pool.Just over an hour's drive from London, 15 minutes from Henley and 20 minutes from Oxford. Enjoy the Cholsey and Wallingford Steam Railway, or a walk around the ruins of Wallingford Castle, once one of the largest in the country but largely destroyed by Oliver Cromwell. There is a town museum in Wallingford and Agatha Christie's home and boathouse nearby. Nearby places include Silverstone, Towester Racecourse and Stowe Gardens. Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill and the spectacular city of Oxford are in close proximity.",
