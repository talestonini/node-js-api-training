            "description": "What makes this exceptional family home so special is the setting, arguably, there is no finer scenery surrounding you this side of of the M25 and one you’d not think was so close to central London. Henry Tate Mews is one of those places that only those in the know, know about! The former home of Henry Tate (yes, sugar and art gallery fame) once owned the huge central house and the grounds that it sat in. These were re-developed sympathetically a number of years ago with the end result being a tranquil environment totally off the beaten track, all accessed via secure gates on the main road.The current owners have enjoyed this house for nearly 12 years and over that time have changed and re-modelled it with the place now offering three double bedrooms, all with en-suite that are located on the top and ground levels. Sandwiched on the middle floor is a wonderful open plan kitchen, living, dining area all of which is well appointed.A secluded city garden can be found to the rear, this in turn opens out to a communal landscaped courtyard which is exclusively for the use of the residents. Parking is to the front along with a sizeable garage.Access into London is very straight forward, a short stroll will deposit you on Streatham High Road where you’ll be spoilt for choices with the bus network and Streatham High Road rail station.",

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge £240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are £40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and £50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from £108 (including VAT) to £240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.",

To the first floor there is a double bedroom with additional children's bedroom/dressing room off, further double bedroom with long distance views and large master bedroom which is currently used as living area.

The foundations on the original hall (Carr House) were taken from the old Kirklees Priory, which stood only 100 meters from the hall, and was demolished by Cromwell during the Protestant/Catholic turmoil. There is evidence that Charlotte Bronte frequently visited Kirklees Hall, and the hall is mentioned in some of her books. In the grounds of Kirklees Hall estate is the grave of Robin Hood. It is said that his Aunt was the prioress of the priory and was known for her healing powers by way of blood letting.",

            "description": "A substantial and attractive 1930’s built family home which has been successfully extended, remodelled and improved, now offering very adaptable three storey accommodation. Due to specific circumstances the house has been extended to accommodate two families and is therefore slightly unusual.Currently, there is an impressive kitchen/dining/living room and adjacent to that is a second kitchen/dining/family room with two bedrooms and bathroom which is being used as a self-contained annexe. Alternatively, a quick glance at the floorplan will demonstrate that this area could be utilised differently. The kitchen could be removed and the room become the principal living room with the ground floor bedrooms used as reception rooms, as required. The rear extension has attractive ceiling lanterns in two of the rooms which provide excellent natural light and bi-fold doors open to the rear decking from the family area, living room and main ground floor bedroom.The first floor has a useful study area currently operating as an office with workstation, plus there are two bedrooms and shower room. The second floor has been converted into the master bedroom with twin wardrobe cupboards, stylish en-suite bathroom and there is a Juliet balcony. The house is superbly presented with fresh and modern décor, stylish contemporary bath/shower rooms (with rainhead showers, double cubicles and a free-standing bath to the en-suite bathroom) and kitchens which is balanced with some original features such as leaded light windows, although the extended rooms have double glazed leaded lights units.The main kitchen features numerous integrated appliances, induction hob, Corian worktops and high gloss units. There are also large porcelain tiles throughout the kitchen/dining/living room and the second kitchen/family room and off the main kitchen is a utility/boot room.Crystal chandeliers in all the main reception areas plus some rooms feature chrome downlighters and every room has chrome sockets, switches etc.Outside, is an adjacent garage, ample off road parking on a shingle driveway, whilst the substantial rear garden has a large timber decking, pergola, shed and lawn.The location is hugely convenient being within a half mile radius to Woking centre and station.Woking has a thriving town centre offering extensive shopping, dining and leisure facilities including The New Victoria Theatre & Cinema, and the Lightbox Gallery.

Both the Basingstoke Canal and the River Wey are close by for walking, cycling and fishing (permit required), whilst nearby Chobham Common is a National Nature Reserve.The area is well served by both state and private schools including: Hoebridge, St Andrews, Greenfield, Halstead, Woking High School, St Dunstan’s and St John the Baptist School.Substantially Extended Aand Flexible AccommodationOpen plan Kitchen/Dining/Living RoomSecond Open Plan Kitchen/Dining/Family RoomTwo Ground Floor BedroomsGround Floor BathroomTwo First Floor Bedrooms And StudyFirst Floor Shower And CloakroomSecond Floor Master Bedroom With En-Suite Bathroom",
