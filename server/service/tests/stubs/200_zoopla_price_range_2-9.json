            "description": "Description   This fabulous detached family home, situated at the end of a sweeping pathway, was built in 1938 for Miss Doris Harrison, daughter of a local millionaire, and is where she resided with her nurse. It was because of this fact that the house is unusual due to a second staircase leading to servants' quarters on the top floor. It has been said that 'Miss Harrison had the bricks for the house handmade and the pointing was an art itself'. In later years the property was bought by Dame Catherine Cookson and her husband Tom, and during their 22 year occupation Catherine spent her days writing in her study and transforming the house and gardens before leaving in 1976.Now the property has been recently refurbished and lovingly restored to echo the splendour of days gone by with a wealth of attractive features and generous accommodation including spacious rooms with high ceilings, plaster cornice and mouldings, handsome fireplaces have become focal points once more, polished wooden flooring and a stunning oak staircase to the first floor.On the ground floor the large reception hall opens into the grand reception rooms, as well as a formal dining room. The large kitchen/breakfast room has ample space for even a professional chef, as well as a boiler room, utility room and larder.The second floor landing is almost a room in itself and it is rumoured that Dame Catherine once housed a grand piano there.

            "description": "The HouseThe Farmhouse is timber framed with a tiled slate roof, with the original building thought to date back to the 15th Century with later additions. The main house offers a generous 3815 square feet of versatile living accommodation which has served our client?S family very well over the past 30 years.The large front porch area leads to the sitting room featuring a beautiful open fireplace with wood-burning stove and brick surround. To the left of the living room is a small library area which leads into another reception room, currently used as a dining room with office. The right of the living room leads to a useful boot-room with WC and separate laundry/airing room, which then leads through to the kitchen.The kitchen is a good size and is fitted around a central island and family table and chairs. There is a range of wooden wall and base units, an electric oven and hob, and space for a fridge freezer. Off the kitchen is a large rear porch leading out to the garden, a useful space for coats and shoes. Finally, through the left of the kitchen is a third reception room, currently used as a second reception room/drawing room.There are two staircases on the ground floor, the stairs to the left-hand side of the house lead to the master suite which has immediate access to a bath and shower room. The other staircase leads up to three further bedrooms which all share the use of a shower room. The second floor has two further rooms (currently set up as a living room and bedroom) with access to a bathroom.The HistoryThe Farmhouse is thought to have been home to Thomas Mills, an historic businessman known locally for his help to the poor and huge contributions towards the education of the town and surrounding area. Schools were opened in his name from 1751 through to the Thomas Mills High School of today.The GroundsThe house lies within 4.8 acres, which include a large area of lawn to the front of the house, a shingle in-and-out drive, woodland, two ponds, a three-bay cart-lodge, former pigsties (used for storage) and a number of paddocks which provide equestrian potential or income from letting.The ClinicThe clinic is a converted barn to the rear of the house which is currently set up as a physiotherapy and hydrotherapy rehabilitation centre, complete with a heated indoor pool, shower facilities, changing rooms, waiting area / reception and treatment room. Another part of the barn is used for storage and the first floor has been converted. This extremely versatile building is currently let at £6,000 per annum but has the potential for several other uses if required.The CottageThis charming renovated cottage is self-contained and whilst currently empty, it could be let out to provide an annual income of around £6,000 per annum, alternatively it would make an ideal annexe. The accommodation includes a living room, kitchen/dining room, bathroom and double bedroom, as-well-as a small conservatory. The cottage also has its own garden area which could be fenced off from the rest of the land, adding to its rental appeal.LocationThe property sits in a screened location in the heart of the peaceful village of Pettistree in Suffolk. The village has a thriving public house () and is only a short drive from Wickham Market which includes most necessary day-to-day amenities. The thriving and extremely popular market town of Woodbridge is just a few miles away.For commuters, Suffolk?S County town of Ipswich is accessible via the A12 and provides direct trains to London Liverpool Street with a journey time of just over an hour.Points to noteThe property is on mains drainage and electricity; the house has night storage heaters with an economy7 supply.The property may fall under ?Mixed use? Estate and thus the stamp duty is lower. The house is Grade two listed.Before booking a viewing of any Bloomfield Grey instruction, we suggest that buyers view its full online details including the street-view representation, the site map, the satellite view and the floor plan. If you have any questions, then please contact Bloomfield Grey.",

            "letting_fees": "When renting a property with Currell, please be aware that fees will apply during the process. Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge £240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are £40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and £50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from £108 (including VAT) to £240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.",

            "description": "English country house with californian vibe A meticulously refurbished country house combining an elegant blend of contemporary and traditional styles. Positioned on the edge of the village, the house sits wonderfully in its plot of approx. 0.75 acres with views from its south facing balcony over the surrounding countryside. Situated less than 10 mins from Market Harborough train station with a direct rail service to London St. Pancras from 55 mins EPC rating: CMain houseA rare example of having perfectly combined a traditional, stone country house with the latest advancements in technology with exquisite detail given over to the internal specification. The house is accessed via bespoke, electric wooden gates onto an extensive driveway with parking for multiple vehicles. The accommodation begins with the kitchen / breakfast room being accessed via the inner hallway and boasting hand crafted oak kitchen, bespoke 'double depth' work tops, two 'Miele' ovens - electric and steam and induction hob. There is a video entry system for the main gates and the tiled floor, like all those throughout the house, benefits from under floor heating. Doors open onto the south facing terrace and the office is accessed via the living area of the kitchen. The accommodation flows on from the internal office space into the stunning 27 ft lounge room / music studio with south facing bay window, Brazilian walnut flooring and multi-fuel burner. The flooring continues with steps rising to the mezzanine sitting area, currently displaying a grand piano, and on to the magnificent drawing room, with views over the landscaped rear garden. Further stairs rise into the vaulted ceiling to another mezzanine housing a study and sitting area. Ground floor accommodation is completed by a bespoke laundry room housing floor to ceiling storage units, 'Corian' work tops and built in sink. This room contains the CCTV system and adjacent to it is a separate cloakroom. The Brazilian walnut flooring continues on the first floor where all of the bedrooms radiate from the bright first floor landing and the family bathroom has 'Porcelanosa' tiling whilst the master bedroom with ensuite is of particular note with its south facing balcony and views over the stunning gardens and countryside beyond. Both bathrooms contain fitments for integrated waterproof televisions.Annexe and swim spaTo the ground floor, the independent annexe boasts an air-conditioned swim spa / gym with a 'dimension 1' swim spa and Jacuzzi as well as a newly fitted 'kitchenette' and an integrated cinema system with projector and amplifier. The glazed doors retract to allow access to the gardens in the summer and the room benefits from under floor heating for the winter months.There is a fully fitted annexe bedroom above from which the landscaped gardens can be admired whilst the ensuite shower room has a 'pebble' tiled floor and 'Porcelanosa' fitments.Gardens and groundsThe rear gardens are of particular note being a wonderfully mature, private space with various zones for entertaining and for different times of the day. There are two main terraces, both facing south, accessed via the main house and the annexe respectively. A decked area includes a semi-permanent marquee looking up the gardens whilst the stunning fire pit, with seating all around, looks back toward the house. The rest of the gardens are mainly laid to lawn and are bordered by stone walls, bamboo and 'Iroko' bespoke fencing and laurel hedgerow. They gently slope up from the house and lead to a large summer house on the eastern boundary. They also contain a 'rain harvesting' system which collects water from the roofs and is connected to a customised sprinkler system that has been professionally designed to provide water throughout the extensive outdoor space.SituationCommunication links are excellent with the A14 approx. Five miles to the south giving access to the M1 and M6 to the west, in turn providing access to Birmingham International, Coventry and East Midlands Airports. Mainline train services are available from Market Harborough to London St Pancras from 55 minutes.SchoolingThere is a wide selection of state and independent schooling in the area including preparatory schools at Spratton Hall, Maidwell Hall and Stoneygate (Great Glen). Secondary schooling is at Rugby, Oakham, Oundle, Wellingborough, Guilsborough and Uppingham whilst both primary and secondary schooling is at Pitsford (Northampton) and Leicester Grammar School (Great Glen).General informationServices: Mains water and electricity connected.

The former White Lion was the first stop on the stagecoach route from London to Portsmouth and, whilst the elevations are mainly 18th century, parts of this historic building date back to the 16th century.The 24 newly built homes, set in three buildings – Barley House, Mackay House and The Malthouse include a collection of two, three and four-bedroom apartments and duplexes along with a three-bedroom house. Each unique new home provides plenty of generously-proportioned living space and all have outside space in the form of private gardens, terraces, balconies, Juliette balconies or roof terraces. All the stylish, energy-efficient homes at White Lion Place have been designed to reflect the grandeur of the listed building and historical relevance of the site and each features the contemporary, high quality specification that is a hallmark of all Beechcroft properties.",

            "description": "St George Wharf is a landmark riverside development spanning across 7 acres of London's hottest area of regeneration, and conveniently, just moments from London's Vauxhall Underground Station. Initially rising 22 storeys but now with the addition of the 48 storey Tower, the tallest sole residential building in the UK, St George Wharf is a focal point of the South Bank. The main development is easily identifiable by its gull-wing roofs and stylish terraces; Broadway Malyan Architects had a willingness to champion innovation and as such have designed an original and expressive building with a fantastic attention to detail. Riverside living does not get much better than this.Residents of this SW8 development, St George Wharf, often comment on its sense of community, with a stunning series of landscaped courtyards and elegant fountains creating an idyllic rural atmosphere in the heart of central London. St George Wharf combines this serene courtyard with state of the art facilities; amenities include a supermarket, restaurant and bar, an nhs Doctors, dentist, a 24hr gymnasium and a spa offering a wide variety of treatments.In keeping with the green ethos of the development, the newly completed Tower will require one third of the energy currently used by similar buildings. Specifically, One, The Tower will house a wind turbine to power common lighting areas and a London Aquifer (complete with heat pump technology) to extract warmth from water to heat apartments during the winter. Triple-glazed windows throughout minimise heat loss in winter whilst ventilated blinds between the glazing protects apartments from heat through direct sunlight.Not only is St George Wharf a peaceful environment in the heart of the capital, it's also a safe one. With apartments accessible to a 24 hour concierge service, CCTV and a video entry system into each property, safety and security in the development was paramount in the developer's approach.Apartments vary from studios to luxury 5 bedroom penthouses, all finished to the highest specification. The breath-taking river views and fantastic transport links ensure St George Wharf is the best of both worlds in terms of luxury and necessity. With Vauxhall Underground Station right on your doorstep Victoria, Green Park and Oxford Circus stations are all just minutes away. The nearby Vauxhall Rail Station means areas such as Waterloo and Clapham Junction are also easily accessible.",

Patio doors access a sizeable rear patio.Formal Dining Room  A large formal dining area, having through light courtesy of a double glazed window to both front and rear. A stone fireplace houses a multi fuel stove and a characterful beamed ceiling provides plenty of charm. Again, this room creating versatile uses could be a play room or second sitting room.Sitting Room  A grand sized sitting room providing a wonderful feel of 'hub of the home' boasting beamed ceilings with exposed stone fire, housing a log burning stove. Two sets of French doors connect both to the front and rear garden as well as providing an abundance of natural light. A wide, open plan, sweeping staircase leads up to the first floor rooms, in addition giving eye-catching characterful period features of the high landing beamed ceiling together with fabulous exposed stone walling.Drawing Room  As our measurements suggest, this is another generous sized room with versatile uses creating opportunity for a games room or an open plan breakfast kitchen.
