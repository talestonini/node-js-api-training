            "description": "This superb property originally built in 1970 has been imaginatively and sympathetically designed to blend with the hillside and local topography, as well as provide stunning views across the English Channel. On a clear day you can see France, watch the ferries going back and forth and in the evening you can even enjoy the twinkling lights of Calais. This lovely family home is in a very quiet and peaceful area as it is situated along a recently resurfaced private road that leads to the Dover Patrol Memorial and acres of National Trust land where you can walk for miles across breathtaking countryside. It is surrounded by a delightful garden and terraces with a large driveway providing plenty of off road and leading to the double garage and steps up to the front door.Off the large, light and bright entrance hall are stairs down to the garage, a cloakroom and a large and useful study. Here you can work undisturbed because the main living area is on the next level up a short flight of stairs. This includes an elegant L shaped sitting room with a veritable wall of windows and bi folding doors to the front terrace while the gorgeous L shaped kitchen/dining room with its muted coloured units, double oven, hob and integrated fridge and freezer will delight anyone who enjoys catering and entertaining. You can wander out to the large rear terrace from here through the patio doors and enjoy the secluded garden that backs onto woodland.Visitors can enjoy the privacy available in the charming guest suite on the next half landing. Here there is also the main bathroom with both a bath and a shower, while the three family double bedrooms and the stunning master suite are on the next floor. Above the guest bedroom is an amazing roof terrace providing excellent sea views where you can congregate for breakfast on a sunny morning. It is accessed via patio doors under a cathedral style window while at the top of the house is a galleried landing and a family room/snug that could also be used as another bedroom if required as it leads to a loft/storage room that could easily be converted to an en-suite bathroom. However, it is an ideal area older children looking for their own space.What the Owner says:We bought this house about three and a half years ago as we love the stunning sea views, looking out at the cliffs of Calais and the spectacular sunrises and sunsets. Natural light floods into the house and at night the moonlight reflecting on the sea can be enchanting. The ever-changing views that include passing ships, boats and yachts provide ongoing interest. However, we have now decided to move so we can be closer to our children and the growing number of grandchildren.We love the friendly village with its restaurants, hotel and pubs as well as a post office, village shop and a library. There are great walks from immediately outside our front door including along the clifftops or down to the charming beach. Alternatively take a stroll along to the South Foreland Lighthouse - the first in the world to have electric light.There are a wide range of societies and clubs including bowls, tennis, cricket, football as well as a history and horticultural society, among many others. The excellent primary school has been voted Outstanding by Ofsted.For those with an interest in boating and sailing there are local marinas, yachting and dinghy sailing clubs. There is good access to London and beyond by road and rail while the village is also well served by buses. As we travel to France several times a year the quick crossing to France by either ferry or the tunnel is a real plus point.Room sizes:Double Garage 23'1 x 16'5 (7.04m x 5.01m)Entrance Hall 16'3 (4.96m) x 12'3 (3.74m) narrowing to 11'8 (3.56m)CloakroomStudy 11'6 (3.51m) narrowing to 8'8 at narrowest point (2.64m) x 9'3 (2.82m)Sitting Room (l-shaped) 20'5 x 14'3 (6.23m x 4.35m) plus 10'2 x 10'2 (3.10m x 3.10m)Kitchen/Dining Room (l-shaped) 17'2 x 11'9 (5.24m x 3.58m) plus 14'0 x 9'6 (4.27m x 2.90m)Utility Room 13'5 x 6'4 (4.09m x 1.93m)LandingBedroom 2 13'8 x 11'1 (4.17m x 3.38m)En-suite Shower RoomBath/Shower RoomBedroom 4 10'2 x 9'0 (3.10m x 2.75m)Bedroom 3 13'9 x 10'4 (4.19m x 3.15m)Master Bedroom 14'3 x 14'3 (4.35m x 4.35m)En-suite Bath/Shower RoomBedroom 5 16'8 x 6'6 (5.08m x 1.98m)Galleried LandingRoof TerraceFamily Room / Snug 17'0 x 12'0 (5.19m x 3.66m)Loft / Storage RoomRear GardenFront GardenEavesDrivewayEavesThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

            "description": "A wonderfully charming cottage with a beautiful 72 ft garden. This natural two bedroom Victorian house offers a brilliant opportunity to develop and extend (stpp) as other similar houses on the street have nearly doubled in size. By extending into the loft and out into the garden it would be possible to create a lovely four bedroom family home (stpp).Currently the house has two reception rooms, one at the front and the other at the back next to the kitchen, which also has access through some pretty French doors into the garden. Upstairs there are two double bedrooms and an immaculate bathroom.SituationBellamy Street is one of the most popular streets in the Nightingale Triangle due to the stunning rows of terraced cottages and the lack of traffic. It is ideally located as it is equidistance (just half a mile) between Balham train station (National Rail and Northern Line) and Clapham South tube station (Northern Line). The house also is situated within the catchment area for some very good local schools.",

            "description": "Location  The house is approached via a sought after cul-de-sac within a short walk of the pretty town of Oxted. This unusually quiet plot, measured in the region of about a third of an acre has an enviable elevated position taking advantage of some far reaching, westerly views. This commuter town is surrounded by National Trust land, and boasts the ever popular Master Park offering year round events. Oxted and Hurst Green stations (both within walking distance) provide mainline services to East Croydon and central London (London Bridge and Victoria - 30-40 minutes). The town includes a Leisure Complex with swimming pool, Independent boutique Cinema and a range of shops including a Morrisons and a Waitrose. Junction 6 of the M25 is approximately 3 miles distant. There are a number of good local state and independent schools for all ages, some within walking distance. These include Limpsfield and Downs Way Infant Schools, St Mary's Junior School and Oxted Secondary School in the state sector and Hazelwood School in the independent sector.Property description  Built in 1960, this detached family home was extended approximately 15 years ago but still has the potential for further building work (subject to planning) and modernisation. There is a useful brick built porch with a window to the front and tiled floor leading to the spacious entrance hall. You are immediately struck by the bright and airy feel to this home. The entrance hall provides two storage cupboards and access to the rest of the well laid out accommodation. To the right is a large room, formerly two separate rooms. The front of this area is the sitting room with an attractive brick built working fire place with tiled hearth and a window to the side. The lounge is to the rear of the house with sliding patio doors to the garden and a box bay window to the side giving fabulous, elevated westerly views. The kitchen/dining room runs across the back of the house. The kitchen has a range of wall and base units with worktop over, a stainless steel 1 1/2 bowl sink with mixer tap and drainer set beneath the window, an integrated double oven, inset hob with extractor over, space for a dishwasher and a larder cupboard.

The utility room sits to the side providing space and plumbing for a washing machine, tumble dryer and fridge/freezer. The family room sits to the front of the house and can be accessed from both the hall and dining area. A cloakroom with w.C., wash hand basin and mirror with light completes the ground floor accommodation.The stairs to the landing splits at the top giving access to the two newer rooms on the left and the three original bedrooms on the right.

Bedroom two is also a generous double size with westerly views over the garden and bedroom three is also a good size double with plenty of space to put wardrobes and other furniture. The two newer rooms are slightly smaller, one with southerly views overlooking the garden, the other with eaves storage and views to the north. One of the bathrooms is conveniently located between these two bedrooms and offers a bath with shower over, wash hand basin, w.C. And airing cupboard. The landing provides access to the spacious loft that is part boarded and has a light and ladder. The family bathroom has a bath with shower over and wash hand basin with the w.C. Located next to the bathroom.Outside  Set on a quiet, residential road and sits in a nicely secluded spot. There is a large driveway to the front of the house providing off road parking for a number of cars. The south west facing plot is surrounded by attractive mature hedging and lies to the side and rear of the house positioned to capture the best of the sun. The garden is mainly laid to lawn with a patio running to the side and rear of the house. A handy gated side passageway provides a path and access to the utility room. There are two sheds tucked away in a corner of the garden.The best bits...  Excellent opportunity to put your own stamp on a good sized family home on a plot that is not over looked on a very popular road within walking distance of Oxted town and its mainline station.",

There's a pretty garden view through a wooden framed sash over the sink. The reception adjoins the kitchen, where a slightly arched front facing sash boasts stripped wooden shutters.The lower return hosts a handy utility and wc which is light and lovely owing to its triple aspect. To the rear, a south–facing patio area and lush healthy lawn make for the perfect bbq venue. Back inside, moving downstairs finds you inspecting the first two double bedrooms. The larger bedroom benefits from fitted shelving units. There's another bathroom on this level and plenty of storage under the stairs. Up to the first return you'll discover a nicely presented bathroom with Travertine floor, wall and counter tiling, bath and shower and vintage radiator.

            "letting_fees": "When renting a property with Currell, please be aware that fees will apply during the process. Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge £240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are £40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and £50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from £108 (including VAT) to £240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.",

            "description": "A delightful family home, this property has a south sea-facing aspect and is named after the 200-year-old mature oak tree, a feature of the beautifully designed rear garden. Built in the 1980s, the property has individual charm and character; there are fireplaces in the two main reception rooms and beams in the kitchen/breakfast room. The elegant lines of this well-maintained and sympathetically improved property are quite unique, providing a substantial home of some 3,400 square feet.In addition, the first-floor balcony is 300 square feet and extends the full width of the house, with direct access from the master bedroom and the first-floor sitting room. The hall includes a charming arch that currently houses a piano. There are stairs to the first floor, of course, and the hall provides separate direct access to most downstairs rooms: The large reception/dining room, kitchen/breakfast room, a utility area and separate downstairs wet room (with shower, toilet and handbasin), and a quiet corner room that works well as a double bedroom or large study. Given its proximity to the adjacent wet room it could be useful as a guest suite or for elderly friends and relatives who find the stairs difficult.An internal brick arch creates open-plan access between the reception/ dining room and the contemporary kitchen/breakfast room, which has a double oven, hob, built-in cupboards and a full range of appliances. Double glass doors from sitting/dining room provide the entrance to a separate spacious games room/library, which has a through aspect and opens directly onto the ground-floor terrace to the front and to the rear garden patio. The ground floor provides excellent space for entertaining or just to relax with family and friends.On the first floor, a large light and airy sitting room and the master bedroom both have wide, sliding doors to the balcony with views across the cliff and the Hythe Imperial Golf Course, to the English Channel beyond which dominates the landscape. On summer evenings and clear days, the French coastline can be seen in the distance to the southeast.There are two additional first-floor double bedrooms and a family bathroom.What the Owner says:Considered the most desirable residential location in the area, Cliff Road is made up of unique, individual homes of different styles and sizes. This property has been in the present owner’s family since 2003. During that time the plot has been re-landscaped and the property updated and modernised. It benefits from a peaceful location, only a few minutes to the sea front and Hythe’s historic town centre. The High Street has a village feel, with an array of individual shops, hairdressers, cafés and restaurants (Waitrose and Sainsbury’s are also close by).On the coast, the Hythe Imperial Hotel has a 9-hole golf course, gym and spa, while the historic Military Canal offers lovely walks along the towpath.More enthusiastic golfers can enjoy 18 holes at Sene Valley, the golf course designed by Henry Cotton that this property backs on to.For rail travellers, the excellent high-speed service from Folkestone West is just 52 minutes to London St. Pancras (36 minutes from Ashford International). Nearby Sandling Station provides a good local rail service, and then on to Waterloo East and Charing Cross. There are also regular local bus services at the end of Cliff Road, and dependable taxis, usually within 15 minutes.Room sizes:Split level ground floorEntrance HallSitting/Dining Area 21'2 x 14'3 (6.46m x 4.35m)Games Room/Library 24'0 x 16'0 (7.32m x 4.88m)Kitchen/Breakfast Area 19'5 x 11'1 (5.92m x 3.38m)Utility 6'6 x 5'3 (1.98m x 1.60m)Shower RoomBedroom 5 13'0 x 11'1 (3.97m x 3.38m)First floorLandingMaster Bedroom 17'11 x 16'2 (5.46m x 4.93m)Bedroom 3 13'1 x 11'2 (3.99m x 3.41m)BathroomBedroom 2 15'0 x 10'11 (4.58m x 3.33m)Sitting Room 21'3 x 14'5 (6.48m x 4.40m)En-suiteOutsideGarage 17'9 x 16'5 (5.41m x 5.01m)South Facing balconyTerraceSecond floorStudy/Bedroom 4 30'7 x 14'3 (9.33m x 4.35m)The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

            "description": "The HouseThe Farmhouse is timber framed with a tiled slate roof, with the original building thought to date back to the 15th Century with later additions. The main house offers a generous 3815 square feet of versatile living accommodation which has served our client?S family very well over the past 30 years.The large front porch area leads to the sitting room featuring a beautiful open fireplace with wood-burning stove and brick surround. To the left of the living room is a small library area which leads into another reception room, currently used as a dining room with office. The right of the living room leads to a useful boot-room with WC and separate laundry/airing room, which then leads through to the kitchen.The kitchen is a good size and is fitted around a central island and family table and chairs. There is a range of wooden wall and base units, an electric oven and hob, and space for a fridge freezer. Off the kitchen is a large rear porch leading out to the garden, a useful space for coats and shoes. Finally, through the left of the kitchen is a third reception room, currently used as a second reception room/drawing room.There are two staircases on the ground floor, the stairs to the left-hand side of the house lead to the master suite which has immediate access to a bath and shower room. The other staircase leads up to three further bedrooms which all share the use of a shower room. The second floor has two further rooms (currently set up as a living room and bedroom) with access to a bathroom.The HistoryThe Farmhouse is thought to have been home to Thomas Mills, an historic businessman known locally for his help to the poor and huge contributions towards the education of the town and surrounding area. Schools were opened in his name from 1751 through to the Thomas Mills High School of today.The GroundsThe house lies within 4.8 acres, which include a large area of lawn to the front of the house, a shingle in-and-out drive, woodland, two ponds, a three-bay cart-lodge, former pigsties (used for storage) and a number of paddocks which provide equestrian potential or income from letting.The ClinicThe clinic is a converted barn to the rear of the house which is currently set up as a physiotherapy and hydrotherapy rehabilitation centre, complete with a heated indoor pool, shower facilities, changing rooms, waiting area / reception and treatment room. Another part of the barn is used for storage and the first floor has been converted. This extremely versatile building is currently let at £6,000 per annum but has the potential for several other uses if required.The CottageThis charming renovated cottage is self-contained and whilst currently empty, it could be let out to provide an annual income of around £6,000 per annum, alternatively it would make an ideal annexe. The accommodation includes a living room, kitchen/dining room, bathroom and double bedroom, as-well-as a small conservatory. The cottage also has its own garden area which could be fenced off from the rest of the land, adding to its rental appeal.LocationThe property sits in a screened location in the heart of the peaceful village of Pettistree in Suffolk. The village has a thriving public house () and is only a short drive from Wickham Market which includes most necessary day-to-day amenities. The thriving and extremely popular market town of Woodbridge is just a few miles away.For commuters, Suffolk?S County town of Ipswich is accessible via the A12 and provides direct trains to London Liverpool Street with a journey time of just over an hour.Points to noteThe property is on mains drainage and electricity; the house has night storage heaters with an economy7 supply.The property may fall under ?Mixed use? Estate and thus the stamp duty is lower. The house is Grade two listed.Before booking a viewing of any Bloomfield Grey instruction, we suggest that buyers view its full online details including the street-view representation, the site map, the satellite view and the floor plan.
