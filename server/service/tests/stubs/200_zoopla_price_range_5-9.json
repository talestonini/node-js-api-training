            "description": "A superb detached family house with self contained annexe in a secluded valley setting well away from traffic at popular Paganhill with grounds of nearly two acres with planning permission to build two detached houses (S.15/1610/ful)Main DescriptionA superb detached family house with self contained annexe in a secluded valley setting well away from traffic at popular Paganhill with grounds of nearly two acres with planning permission to build two detached houses (S.15/1610/ful)A well presented individual detached family house situated in a quiet secluded position a couple of miles west of Stroud centre. This location allows for easy access to local amenities and several well regarded schools, with country and canal side walks within easy reach. The property is built using traditional methods under a pitched roof and has clearly been the subject of comprehensive improvement, with flexible accommodation arranged over two floors.An entrance hall, cloakroom/W.C, 26’ sitting room with fireplace, dining room, lovely 20’ kitchen/family room with hand made units, utility room and boot room are found on the ground floor. The first floor hosts a landing, master bedroom with en suite bathroom, family bathroom and four further double bedrooms. A self contained annexe is situated above the garage and comprises an open plan living space with kitchen area, two bedrooms and a bathroom.OutsideA private drive and bridge leads over the brook into the grounds. These levels gardens are quite spectacular and extend to almost two acres, with the house in the middle of the grounds. Large level lawns stretching out from the front of the property. This area is beautifully planted, with mature specimen trees and a variety of shrubs and planted borders and a paved sitting area with a pergola over by the house. The parking area is to the front of the house and there is space here to park several vehicles and still turn, with an integral double garage on the right hand side of the house. The drive leads around to the rear of the property and another level hard standing area and a detached garage/workshop with wood store. The gardens then extend beyond this area, running down to the brook and sloping up at the back of the plot. The current owners have obtained planning permission to build two detached houses here (S.15/1610/ful) and prospective developers may look to apply for an amendment to this permission to build more than just two houses.LocationStroud town centre is only a short drive away for a wider range of shops and amenities, state, grammar and private schools, a leisure and sports centre, and a main line railway station, with inter city services travelling to London (Paddington). Cirencester (11 miles), Cheltenham (14 miles) and Swindon (26 miles), are all within comfortable driving distance. Junction 13, M5 motorway is approximately 8 miles distant.",

Being a Town, Wallingford offers every means of amenity one would expect. The narrow streets with their variety of small shops, pubs and restaurants, the antique shops in the Lamb Arcade, and the parks, commons and gardens make it a very pleasant town.

Running from Ivanhoe Road to Grove Hill Road, this pretty street is very appealing for families and professionals, located around the corner from Champion Hill and the beautiful Camberwell Grove. The houses here are all well preserved, many having original sash windows, plus there's a strong community spirit amongst the neighbours. East Dulwich, Bellenden Road and Camberwell are all within walking distance - you really are magnificently placed. This idyllic property has four bedrooms, two receptions (including dining room), plus two bathrooms.This house is slightly elevated and has a contemporary front garden with steps up to the door. Inside, a typical Victorian layout stretches ahead, but having a sweeping curved wall to your right. This is where the reception room can be found fronting the street, housing original coving overhead and an original fireplace with solid marble surround. Behind this room is a delightfully surprising bedroom leading into a sun room/conservatory with glass roof, a cute addition for some extra space. French doors at the far end take you out into the decked garden.Further down the hall, you pass an understairs cupboard that takes you down to the old coal cellar, ideal for storing your bits and bobs, while to your right is a shower room and w.C. Opposite this is a further storage cupboard, while heading on you find the second reception, currently used as a dining room. This space opens directly into the kitchen at the rear, so it’s current use is what one would typically do. A huge side aspect window draws in light and there is an extremely modern concrete floor. The kitchen has an awesome double butler's sink, white units and natural tumbled slate splashbacks. A back door leads out to a sunny south facing garden with a decked seating area and surrounding raised beds.Upstairs, the landing is split by a few steps up towards the front of the property. Stretching across the width of the house is a glorious master bedroom with a bay window and single sash to one side. Exposed brickwork covers the chimney breast. Next door is a second double with cast iron fireplace and garden views. A separate w.C comes before the main bathroom which has a white suite with a shower attachment and heated towel rail. A fourth double at the rear has neutral walls and oatmeal carpets and is quietly tucked away overlooking the garden.Very nicely located on all fronts this home offers easy access to both the City and central London – walk eight minutes to Denmark Hill station for regular services to Victoria and London Bridge. East Dulwich is within 10 minutes’ walk for good services to London Bridge too. Alternatively catch a 185 or 176 from the top of the street. Shopping is a cinch with Sainsbury’s two minutes away and the delis of East Dulwich a little further. Going out? Lordship Lane has an ever expanding number of cool bars and restaurants and there are more in nearby Bellenden Road. Dog Kennel Hill School has an exemplary record and is close by. For active pursuits the Peckham Pulse is a jog away or spend a few hours at the library and then go on to the cinema on Rye Lane!",

This space opens directly into the kitchen at the rear, so it’s current use is what one would typically do. A huge side aspect window draws in light and there is an extremely modern concrete floor. The kitchen has an awesome double butler's sink, white units and natural tumbled slate splashbacks. A back door leads out to a sunny south facing garden with a decked seating area and surrounding raised beds.  Upstairs, the landing is split by a few steps up towards the front of the property. Stretching across the width of the house is a glorious master bedroom with a bay window and single sash to one side. Exposed brickwork covers the chimney breast. Next door is a second double with cast iron fireplace and garden views. A separate w.C comes before the main bathroom which has a white suite with a shower attachment and heated towel rail. A fourth double at the rear has neutral walls and oatmeal carpets and is quietly tucked away overlooking the garden.  Very nicely located on all fronts this home offers easy access to both the City and central London – walk eight minutes to Denmark Hill station for regular services to Victoria and London Bridge. East Dulwich is within 10 minutes’ walk for good services to London Bridge too. Alternatively catch a 185 or 176 from the top of the street. Shopping is a cinch with Sainsbury’s two minutes away and the delis of East Dulwich a little further. Going out? Lordship Lane has an ever expanding number of cool bars and restaurants and there are more in nearby Bellenden Road. Dog Kennel Hill School has an exemplary record and is close by. For active pursuits the Peckham Pulse is a jog away or spend a few hours at the library and then go on to the cinema on Rye Lane!</p>",

            "description": "This huge 1732 sq ft, loft-style, three double bedroom, two bathroom apartment in this sought after school conversion is a rare find. Boasting the great floor to ceiling windows typical of school conversions, the space is flooded with light, enjoys double height ceilings, wood flooring, state of the art appliances and beautifully finished bathrooms; one of which has a Jacuzzi and a shower that doubles as a steam-room, that all offers the sense of luxury, while a truly enormous open plan reception area offers the lifestyle to boot. The apartment has two private front doors, so purchasers will benefit from use of the manicured communal gardens, without having to share a communal entrance area. This apartment is split over two floors and due to the large square footage and layout, the property can be configured differently to suit a potential purchasers search criteria. The property has a multitude of selling points, to name a few; an owned secure off street parking space, two bathrooms, own entrances, CCTV, a substantial double bedroom with enough floor space to have a reading/relaxation area nestled within the room. You will be hard-pressed to find comparable properties with dimensions that rival this maisonette and the total internal floor space will be similar to period houses within the immediate vicinity with higher asking prices. With its own front doors and large internal square footage, this property is a feasible alternative to period properties which often require a higher level of up-keep. The property is only a short walk from the vibrant shops, nightlife and culinary marvels of Clapham and Brixton, as well as both Clapham Common and Brockwell Park. Excellent connections to the City and the West End through Clapham Common, Clapham North and Brixton underground stations and Clapham High Street mainline station. Because this space is truly magnificent, we expect competition and a high level of interest, and thus strongly recommend pre-registration. We will be holding structured viewings on a first-come, first-served basis. Call now for your choice of viewing slot.",

            "description": "This beautifully refurbished home can be found on a private road that leads to the footpaths and trails that meander through the South Foreland Valley, a protected area of Special Scientific Interest around St. Margaret’s Bay, so is very quiet and peaceful. From the moment you walk through the front door into the very spacious and welcoming entrance hall, you will be mesmerised by the view. Whether you rush straight outside through one of the two sets of French doors onto the terrace to get a better look or wander through the bevelled glass doors into the light and elegant lounge with its two sets of French doors leading directly onto the terrace, bookshelves (handmade by Thoroughly Wood) and attractive fireplace, it is still the view across the countryside, white cliffs and the sea that takes your breath away. At night, in the winter, the clear skies make it an excellent spot for anyone interested in astronomy. There is a delightful open-plan feel about this lovely home as you flow through from the hall to the dining room and the sitting area to the modern bespoke kitchen and breakfast area designed by City Kitchens of Canterbury. It includes a built-in double oven, microwave and hob, integrated Miele dishwasher, fridge, freezer and washing machine while the large breakfast area also has double French doors to the terrace so you can sit here and enjoy the great outdoors. There is a large study overlooking the gardens, as well as a separate bedroom and bathroom accessed through glass doors. As the older ‘cottage’ part of the house was built at the turn of the last century and the newer extension was added circa 2002, the house has two staircases. The first leads to the master bedroom with its wall of mirrored and wood wardrobes, modern bathroom with bath, power shower and underfloor heating, as well as two superb balconies where you can sit over your morning coffee admiring the view or enjoy a nightcap watching the twinkling lights of Calais. Another double bedroom and bathroom up the second staircase provides guests or family members with their own private, en suite facilities.What the Owner says:We have lived in our lovely home for the past 10 years and spent a year completely remodelling it. Our aim has been to create a wonderful place to live, with the emphasis on a light and airy environment where most of the windows and the six sets of French doors look out onto the magnificent views of the Channel and South Foreland Valley. We wanted to make a home andnot just refurbish a house, and hope the next owners will be able to enjoy it as much as we have – whether they are looking for a permanent home or a lovely weekend and holiday retreat. St. Margaret’s is a very community-spirited village and has been home to a number of well-known celebrities. Peter Ustinov bought a small military building on the clifftop. Noel Coward owned White Cliffs, which he subsequently sold to Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond. It is thought that Ian Fleming based his character James Bond’s code name 007 on the bus service which ran from Deal to London. There are two hotels and two public houses as well as a post office, village shop and a regular bus service to Dover, Deal and Canterbury and a wide range of societies and clubs. Residents are also able to use the St. Margaret’s resort, making use of the gym, sauna and swimming pool. You will find plenty of wonderful walks from virtually outside the front door to Kingsdown, the Dover Patrol Memorial and the SouthForeland Lighthouse – the first in the world with electric light.

            "description": "A stunning grade II* listed farmhouse. 4 reception rooms, fabulous kitchen/breakfast room, 4/5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Delightful gardens, workshop/stables and 12 acre paddock.The property is a well maintained and beautifully presented listed property (Grade 2* - considered to be of regional importance), full of period features including inglenook fireplaces, beams in many rooms, panelled walls and flagstone floors. Unusually for an old period farmhouse, the layout of rooms is very well suited to modern living, with the reception rooms being of good sizes and connecting together very well. The house is almost fully double glazed. In addition there are 2 separate staircases which offer a flexible use of the space.On entering the property the period features are immediately evident. The hallway, with plank and muntin screen and old quarry tiled floor, leads through to the ancient buttery with timber balusters, which is currently used as a cloakroom. To the rear is a light and airy study and WC. This lends itself to downstairs en-suite facilities if required.The sitting room is a truly delightful room. It is heavily beamed with an inglenook fireplace containing a wood burning fire, and built-in cupboard fronted with antique reclaimed wood. The Ham Stone front mullion window has a window seat and overlooks the cottage-style garden.The kitchen/breakfast room is the real heart of the home with an oil/electric Aga built into a fireplace with timber beam over. A stone mullioned window with window seat overlooks the front garden and there is plenty of space to accommodate a dining table. The floor features original flagstones, and the units comprise granite work surfaces with hand-made limed oak and cream units with integrated dish washer. To the rear is the utility room leading to the rear garden.From the kitchen, double doors lead to the dining room, which again has a host of period features and is a wonderful room for entertaining. Beyond the dining room and at the East end of the house is a very light and spacious morning room with access to the garden, staircase to a twin bedroom with views over the rear garden and fields, and stylish bathroom. This part of the house can be configured as separate living accommodation if required.First floor:Still in the oldest part of the house, the master bedroom has a handsome Ham Stone fireplace, a wardrobe disguised behind the wood panelling and a small arched stone window. Off the bedroom there is a dressing area which then leads to a good sized en-suite bathroom. An old, latched, wooden door leads to very large boarded attic.A further bedroom along the landing features an old timber window to the rear garden and large en-suite bathroom which is also accessible from the landing.The third bedroom is \"The Cheese Room\" named because of its previous incarnation as a store room for truckles of cheese, clearly remembered by Mrs Fox who lived in the house in the 1950s and subsequently lived in one of the stone cottages directly opposite. The Cheese Room has been divided into two rooms, one overlooking the front garden, and one with views to the rear garden.Barn/stable blockA substantial 18m x 9m barn lies within the curtilage of the property. Recently renovated, it comprises potential stabling for 4 horses, has vehicle access and a 12m x 6m mezzanine workshop area with clear roof panels, power and water.Situated in the popular village of Leigh, renowned for its vibrant community, the village lies some five miles southwest of the beautiful abbey town of Sherborne with its famous private schools, and just a few miles from Leweston School. Buses stop at the old village cross in the village centre and provide transport to local state schools.",

The lounge is of epic proportions perfect for the family functions.As you ascend to the first floor, you’re greeted by one of the most awe-inspiring master bedroom suites - spacious and with the added bonus of a large dressing room and en-suite bathroom.The first floor also has two further double bedrooms and an enviable bathroom suite.The current owners have made many improvements to the property since they moved in, including going up into the loft space.Two further bedrooms (one with en-suite), a bathroom and a study have been added, with each bedroom benefiting from a dormer window to provide extra headroom.One of the key features of the property is that all but one of the bedrooms have a rear aspect making the most of the peace and tranquillity that comes with the views over the green belt land.Externally, the property boasts a large garden with heated outdoor swimming pool perfect for entertaining.The front and side aspect offers several parking options along with a double garage that is currently being utilised as a gym/games room.All of this, and only just over a mile from Epping – this property is the complete package!What the Owner says:After moving from Central London, we were amazed at the sheer scale of this property. There were improvements we knew we had to make to make it the perfect family home, but it has all been worth the time and effort.Our master bedroom suite is one of our favourite features of the property, we know we are never going to have anything like it in our next property and we will miss it dearly.One thing we will take away with us is the many happy memories we have entertaining our guests in the garden and the games room.

With concealed cistern. Within the bathroom there is a linen cupboard.Garden Store: - 14' 3'' x 9' 6'' (4.34m x 2.89m)A doorway from the living room leads to a garden store which has a doorway leading to a small terrace and the extensive grounds and a further doorway leads to a rear store beyond which access is gained to much of the service area that runs beneath the main property which is both extensive and cavernous.Within this part of the property there is a power point for a generator in the event of a mains power failure and a series of interconnecting water tanks allow the collection of household waste water that could be used for the watering of garden plants and shrubs in the event of a drought when water restrictions are in force.Garaging:Garaging for at least four motor cars is provided within the garage which measures 34'7\" x 20'7\" access being gained via two panelled doors which are radio controlled via a Hormann remote control system operated from not only within the property but also from approaching vehicles. An electric light and power supply is installed and there is ample room for workshops and benches without limiting the parking of motor cars.Gardens and Grounds:The property is approached across a brick set entrance which leads to a substantial driveway and courtyard with fixed set gravel interspersed with granite sets which provides parking for a significant number of motor cars and leads onward to the front entrance and the garaging.To either side of the drive there are lawned gardens having inset flower borders and shrubs, the gardens extending around the whole of the property.To the south/south east sweeping lawns are bounded for the most part by mature, trimmed conifer hedging which affords considerable privacy and seclusion, the grounds to the rear of the property containing a number of ornamental shrubs, bushes and trees together with a fishpond with stone set surround which makes an attractive feature.There are extensive walkways with paved steps and terraces which lead to further terraced areas with inset flowerbeds beyond which there is an area allocated for the growing of soft fruit and a lower level kitchen garden for the cultivation of vegetables.An aluminium framed greenhouse is discreetly located to the rear of the property and is currently used for the propagation of young plants and vegetables. Within the northern part of the garden there are a number of attractive evergreen and deciduous shrubs, bushes and trees.Outbuildings:Garden Store/Workshop: - 20' 7'' x 7' 9'' (6.27m x 2.36m)Which interconnects in open plan style to a further storage area presently used for housing lawnmowers and other garden equipment.

With wash hand basin.Services & Technical Information:Heating & Ventilation:There is heat recovery ventilation in the kitchen/dining area and the master bedroom/laundry area. This allows 75% of the heat which would be lost with extracted air to be transferred to the fresh incoming air.The heat recovery ventilation system in the swimming pool hall is balanced to provide reduced air pressure to ensure that air movement is from the house into the pool area. The unusual ionising purification system for the pool water is efficient and completely odour-free.Television & Hi-Fi:A television aerial amplifier feeds a signal to the house from the lounge unit so that a video may be watched from any aerial point. The hi-fi wiring interconnects from the lounge to the kitchen, dining room, ballroom, pool hall and downstairs room. The wiring to the hi-fi and television system will remain with the property although loudspeakers and hi-fi units could be made available by separate negotiation.Security:The house has a comprehensive security system connected to the police via a security monitoring service. The lower ground level rooms are on a separate subcircuit enabling this area to be protected at all times even when the rest of the house is in use, the occupants being immediately alerted in the event of any intruder to this area.Personal attack buttons on the security alarm system are located within the hall, bedroom and utility room. A top of the range Chubb security safe is installed which will remain with the property.Central Heating Conditioning:Waste heat from the air conditioning in the lounge/lower ground floor and the ballroom is used to heat the swimming pool. It is normal for the gas air heating for the pool not to be required between May and September in any year.The central heating is designed as five separate units so that if a fault arises only a small part of the complete heating system is out of action.Electricity Supply:There is a mains electric supply to the property which is wired to provide a separate power supply to the freezers so that in the event of a failure of the main circuit, the freezer supply is not interfered with. It should also be noted that there is a separate point for the connection of a generator in the event of a complete external power supply failure, as mentioned earlier within this brochure.External Electrical Information:Outside power points are provided to the front garden fountain, plus a spare socket, to the front near the main front door and to the front at the side of the garage with multiple points near the lower garden pond controlled by switches in the ballroom.The walled garden light is switched from the dining room and the front garden floodlight is controlled by a light sensor with front garden \"lamp posts\" controlled by a time switch.
