            "description": "A delightful family home, this property has a south sea-facing aspect and is named after the 200-year-old mature oak tree, a feature of the beautifully designed rear garden. Built in the 1980s, the property has individual charm and character; there are fireplaces in the two main reception rooms and beams in the kitchen/breakfast room. The elegant lines of this well-maintained and sympathetically improved property are quite unique, providing a substantial home of some 3,400 square feet.In addition, the first-floor balcony is 300 square feet and extends the full width of the house, with direct access from the master bedroom and the first-floor sitting room. The hall includes a charming arch that currently houses a piano. There are stairs to the first floor, of course, and the hall provides separate direct access to most downstairs rooms: The large reception/dining room, kitchen/breakfast room, a utility area and separate downstairs wet room (with shower, toilet and handbasin), and a quiet corner room that works well as a double bedroom or large study. Given its proximity to the adjacent wet room it could be useful as a guest suite or for elderly friends and relatives who find the stairs difficult.An internal brick arch creates open-plan access between the reception/ dining room and the contemporary kitchen/breakfast room, which has a double oven, hob, built-in cupboards and a full range of appliances. Double glass doors from sitting/dining room provide the entrance to a separate spacious games room/library, which has a through aspect and opens directly onto the ground-floor terrace to the front and to the rear garden patio. The ground floor provides excellent space for entertaining or just to relax with family and friends.On the first floor, a large light and airy sitting room and the master bedroom both have wide, sliding doors to the balcony with views across the cliff and the Hythe Imperial Golf Course, to the English Channel beyond which dominates the landscape. On summer evenings and clear days, the French coastline can be seen in the distance to the southeast.There are two additional first-floor double bedrooms and a family bathroom.What the Owner says:Considered the most desirable residential location in the area, Cliff Road is made up of unique, individual homes of different styles and sizes. This property has been in the present owner’s family since 2003. During that time the plot has been re-landscaped and the property updated and modernised. It benefits from a peaceful location, only a few minutes to the sea front and Hythe’s historic town centre. The High Street has a village feel, with an array of individual shops, hairdressers, cafés and restaurants (Waitrose and Sainsbury’s are also close by).On the coast, the Hythe Imperial Hotel has a 9-hole golf course, gym and spa, while the historic Military Canal offers lovely walks along the towpath.More enthusiastic golfers can enjoy 18 holes at Sene Valley, the golf course designed by Henry Cotton that this property backs on to.For rail travellers, the excellent high-speed service from Folkestone West is just 52 minutes to London St. Pancras (36 minutes from Ashford International). Nearby Sandling Station provides a good local rail service, and then on to Waterloo East and Charing Cross. There are also regular local bus services at the end of Cliff Road, and dependable taxis, usually within 15 minutes.Room sizes:Split level ground floorEntrance HallSitting/Dining Area 21'2 x 14'3 (6.46m x 4.35m)Games Room/Library 24'0 x 16'0 (7.32m x 4.88m)Kitchen/Breakfast Area 19'5 x 11'1 (5.92m x 3.38m)Utility 6'6 x 5'3 (1.98m x 1.60m)Shower RoomBedroom 5 13'0 x 11'1 (3.97m x 3.38m)First floorLandingMaster Bedroom 17'11 x 16'2 (5.46m x 4.93m)Bedroom 3 13'1 x 11'2 (3.99m x 3.41m)BathroomBedroom 2 15'0 x 10'11 (4.58m x 3.33m)Sitting Room 21'3 x 14'5 (6.48m x 4.40m)En-suiteOutsideGarage 17'9 x 16'5 (5.41m x 5.01m)South Facing balconyTerraceSecond floorStudy/Bedroom 4 30'7 x 14'3 (9.33m x 4.35m)The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

            "description": "The apartment benefits from direct garden square views and is accessed through a beautiful red brick Victorian conversion. The apartment comprises semi open-plan reception room ideal for entertaining and dining whilst enjoying the stunning garden views offered via three large floor-to-ceiling French windows. The sleeping space consists of a spacious double bedroom with built-in storage. The mezzanine level, located above the reception room and kitchen is ideal for use as an extra sleeping space or as an extension to the reception area. The remaining inclusions are a second bedroom/snug area and walk-in wardrobe and a private balcony overlooking Nevern Square which is large enough for a table and a number of chairs.The square is built in a style known as \"Domestic Revival\", which is quite different from that of the nearby streets. This style had been pioneered in the 1870s by architects such as J.J. Stevenson and Norman Shaw, for example in Palace Gate and Queen's Gate. Various features are derived from English and Flemish houses of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, hence the use of the term \"Revival\". The houses are built of exposed brick, rather than stucco, using contrasting yellow and red bricks.• First floor flat with balcony• Views over and access to the garden square• Mezzanine level with second bedroom, study and walk-in wardrobe• Ample storage space• Contemporary kitchen and bathroom• Share of FreeholdThe nearest Tube station is Earl's Court (Piccadilly and District lines), with the motorist benefiting from quick access to the A4/M4 for routes to central London, Heathrow Airport and the M25.

            "description": "The HouseThe Farmhouse is timber framed with a tiled slate roof, with the original building thought to date back to the 15th Century with later additions. The main house offers a generous 3815 square feet of versatile living accommodation which has served our client?S family very well over the past 30 years.The large front porch area leads to the sitting room featuring a beautiful open fireplace with wood-burning stove and brick surround. To the left of the living room is a small library area which leads into another reception room, currently used as a dining room with office. The right of the living room leads to a useful boot-room with WC and separate laundry/airing room, which then leads through to the kitchen.The kitchen is a good size and is fitted around a central island and family table and chairs. There is a range of wooden wall and base units, an electric oven and hob, and space for a fridge freezer. Off the kitchen is a large rear porch leading out to the garden, a useful space for coats and shoes. Finally, through the left of the kitchen is a third reception room, currently used as a second reception room/drawing room.There are two staircases on the ground floor, the stairs to the left-hand side of the house lead to the master suite which has immediate access to a bath and shower room. The other staircase leads up to three further bedrooms which all share the use of a shower room. The second floor has two further rooms (currently set up as a living room and bedroom) with access to a bathroom.The HistoryThe Farmhouse is thought to have been home to Thomas Mills, an historic businessman known locally for his help to the poor and huge contributions towards the education of the town and surrounding area. Schools were opened in his name from 1751 through to the Thomas Mills High School of today.The GroundsThe house lies within 4.8 acres, which include a large area of lawn to the front of the house, a shingle in-and-out drive, woodland, two ponds, a three-bay cart-lodge, former pigsties (used for storage) and a number of paddocks which provide equestrian potential or income from letting.The ClinicThe clinic is a converted barn to the rear of the house which is currently set up as a physiotherapy and hydrotherapy rehabilitation centre, complete with a heated indoor pool, shower facilities, changing rooms, waiting area / reception and treatment room. Another part of the barn is used for storage and the first floor has been converted. This extremely versatile building is currently let at £6,000 per annum but has the potential for several other uses if required.The CottageThis charming renovated cottage is self-contained and whilst currently empty, it could be let out to provide an annual income of around £6,000 per annum, alternatively it would make an ideal annexe. The accommodation includes a living room, kitchen/dining room, bathroom and double bedroom, as-well-as a small conservatory. The cottage also has its own garden area which could be fenced off from the rest of the land, adding to its rental appeal.LocationThe property sits in a screened location in the heart of the peaceful village of Pettistree in Suffolk. The village has a thriving public house () and is only a short drive from Wickham Market which includes most necessary day-to-day amenities. The thriving and extremely popular market town of Woodbridge is just a few miles away.For commuters, Suffolk?S County town of Ipswich is accessible via the A12 and provides direct trains to London Liverpool Street with a journey time of just over an hour.Points to noteThe property is on mains drainage and electricity; the house has night storage heaters with an economy7 supply.The property may fall under ?Mixed use? Estate and thus the stamp duty is lower. The house is Grade two listed.Before booking a viewing of any Bloomfield Grey instruction, we suggest that buyers view its full online details including the street-view representation, the site map, the satellite view and the floor plan.

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge £240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are £40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and £50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from £108 (including VAT) to £240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above.
