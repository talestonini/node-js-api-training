The current owners have secured planning permission for a double storey side return and rear extension. If you're looking for a project to sink your teeth into, we have the architect plans available.Entering on the raised ground floor you'll be pleased to find original dado rails separating complimentary wall shades. Rich hardwood flooring runs from the hall into the bright rear facing well stocked kitchen. Here you'll fall in love with thick solid counters, sleek white cabinets, a one and a half bowl sink and drainer and a cracking five ring gas range. There's a pretty garden view through a wooden framed sash over the sink. The reception adjoins the kitchen, where a slightly arched front facing sash boasts stripped wooden shutters.The lower return hosts a handy utility and wc which is light and lovely owing to its triple aspect. To the rear, a south–facing patio area and lush healthy lawn make for the perfect bbq venue. Back inside, moving downstairs finds you inspecting the first two double bedrooms. The larger bedroom benefits from fitted shelving units. There's another bathroom on this level and plenty of storage under the stairs. Up to the first return you'll discover a nicely presented bathroom with Travertine floor, wall and counter tiling, bath and shower and vintage radiator. The first floor hosts two more light and airy double bedrooms - the main bedroom with twin sash windows overlooking the front garden, has handy fitted wardrobes.

The first reception benefits from a Carara marble hand sculptured fireplace and a stunning bay window overlooking the picturesque water and gardens. There is a formal dining room with French windows opening out into the rear gardens. The substantial living kitchen is fitted with Carl Josef wall and base units and Corian worktops. The sliding glass walls from the living kitchen give access to the veranda which we consider the best seating area to appreciate the spectacular views. The ground floor cloakroom/wc features an Italian glass hand wash basin and low level wc.What The Owner SaysIt is a great easy living family house, perfect for hosting and entertaining. We've thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Planning and building the house was a joy. We are reluctantly selling our pride and joy due to family commitments.Page 2 left 2 imagespage 2 right 2 imagespage 3 left 2 imagespage 3 right 2 images",

The house is characterised by its high ceilings and period features. The large kitchen is situated in the middle of the ground floor enabling two well appointed reception rooms the rear reception leading out to the enormous rear garden with southerly aspect.Further scope for improvements, extensions and enhancements subject to planning consents, but the property is not in a conservation area and similar properties have undergone extensive works.Locals are familiar with Melbourne Ave due to its location in a central spot but being particularly restrictive to passing traffic as it is no entrance from Uxbridge Rd and homeowners access from Regina Rd from the south. In previous years these large, semi-detached homes have been popular with families looking to upsize but stay in close proximity to the schools, parks and community that Ealing is famed for.For commuting into the City you are close to West Ealing station. A station that provides current access through overground services to Paddington and also provides Heathrow Connect services. From 2019 the station is an appointed 'Crossrail' stationwith access times to Bond St and Canary Wharf scheduled at 13 min and 27 min respectively on direct trains, holding 1500 commuters.Please call Go View London on for your appointment to view.",

            "description": "The exclusive and much envied Shrewsbury Wood development lies within the heart of Prestwich Clough, which, whilst being a tranquil conservation area with protected wildlife, is itself approximately four miles from Manchester City Centre and only a mile away from the vibrant, bustling and thriving Prestwich Village with its quality schools, renowned restaurants, shops and bars.Built to the highest of specifications and designed by someone with a clear eye for detail, Cardwells are privileged to be chosen by Danat Homes, as the exclusive agent to market these exquisite and architecturally stunning six bedroom, six bathroom detached family homes. Set within landscaped gardens, each of these Freehold properties has a double garage plus private parking for up to six vehicles -secured by a remote controlled electric gate with video intercom system - and comes with the peace of mind of a 10 year Checkmate house warranty.Designed with modern day living in mind, all rooms have ultra low energy LED lighting, TV points and cat 5 data cabling, with selected power sockets having usb charging facilities. The ground floor and master bathroom enjoy underfloor heating whilst the hot water and heating is provided by highly efficient gas fired condensing boilers with zone controls. For your additional peace of mind the property has an alarm, pre wired for CCTV and has both security and ambient lighting within the grounds.With accommodation set over three levels and a flexible layout with options to create additional living space if desired, we recommend that you speak with the Cardwells team to arrange your private escorted viewing in order to fully appreciate all that is on offer. Please note that not all photographs are of this plot and are for illustrative purposes only.They say that first impressions count and when you and your guests first step into the hall and see the breathtakingly beautiful Oak Hardwood central staircase rising through the full height of the house, with galleried landings to each floor and Oak hardwood doors leading off, they will be seriously and rightfully impressed. The Kitchen is the heart of any home and this magnificent white open plan SieMatic kitchen with its Quooker instant hot water tap, Neff ovens, microwave, plate warmer, larder fridge, freezer, beautiful Corian work tops and polished stone floors, with underfloor heating, is certain to get yours racing.

Bedroom four on the first floor, for example, has been specifically laid out to offer the option of being used as a playroom or study. The garage is accessible from the hall as well as the utility room so that those preferring this space to be converted into an additional living room can enter from the main hall. The relaxing master bedroom suite offers the comfort and convenience of a large walk in wardrobe and luxurious 5 piece en suite featuring, amongst other essentials, his and hers sinks with marble floor and wall tiles. The remaining five bedrooms all have their own style and character design features, which are often lacking in new build properties. Some features are unique to each bedroom but may include vaulted ceilings, roof lights and Juliette balcony to create comfortable and interesting spaces in which to relax.The family bathroom, guest w.C and all five en suites have been beautifully designed and finished in Laufen and Vitra sanitaryware with porcelain tiles to the walls and floors. The showers have both drench and hand held shower heads which are fed by large, high pressure storage facilities ensuring that everyone can enjoy the most invigorating of showers.Having travelled through the imposing electric gate, the driveway provides plentiful parking and leads to the integral double garage with remote controlled electric door. To the rear is a magnificent stone patio extending to a lawned area with further landscaped garden beyond. We are informed that the plot extends to 0.25 acre.",

            "description": "Jt Clarke London, are pleased to present to the market this sensational three bedroom Townhouse on the niche and sought after location of Royal Court, Surrey Quays SE16.This really is an amazing property from size, style and location you will be spoilt all round.The property comprises garage to the lower ground floor with mezzanine level currently used as a utility area with plumbing and electricity.To the raised ground floor you have a fully tiled wet room, double bedroom with storage and access out on to the beautiful garden, which includes hot tub which the vendor will be leaving, garden furniture and an out house at the bottom of the garden which includes sink, fridge, lights and a widescreen TV. Ideal for those summer nights with friends over for a bbq or just relaxing in the hot tub watching your favourite film.Leading up the wooden stairs to the first floor you are greeted with an amazing open space with fully fitted kitchen to the right and access to two private balconies, one to the front and one to the rear.To the top floor you have another double bedroom, family bathroom and master bedroom with en-suite which also benefits from ample storage to the master.The history of this location is something truly special and unique and when the street lights reflect on the neighbouring waterside it creates an ambience and sparkle making this place even more magical.During World War II Surrey Docks had strong links to Scandinavia and the Baltic Region and it housed the Norwegian Government-in-exile. Rotherhithe is home to a Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish Church.The relationship with Scandinavia and the Baltic is also reflected in the names of some of the buildings (such as the King Frederik IX Tower), the street names (e.G. Finland Street, Sweden Gate, Baltic Quay, Norway Gate, Helsinki Square) or other place names (e.G. Greenland Dock). Another major influence factor was trade with Russia and Canada (mainly timber), reflected in names such as Canada Water and the Russia Dock Woodland.Offered with no onward chain and sold as seen.

Please bear in mind changes such as seasonal promotions do occur so contact our lettings branch directly for an accurate assessment of your rental needs.<br><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong><br>Tenancy application/references</strong></h3><br>When a suitable property to rent has been found all persons aged eighteen or over will complete an Application Form and will be named in the Tenancy Agreement. We will take up references on behalf of our client, your landlord, which may include a bank reference for which your bank may charge a nominal fee, a credit reference, an employer's reference, an accountant¿s reference, and a previous landlord reference. A payment to indicate your commitment is required when you submit your application and is held against expenses and fees incurred. If your application is successful this payment will be deducted from your Initial Money. The payment is non-refundable should your application be unsuccessful or withdrawn in certain circumstances, the details of which are set out in the tinfo (Tenant Information Sheet). Please note that this payment in advance does not constitute a tenancy or offer of a tenancy but is proof of your serious intention to proceed.<br><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong><br>Tenancy agreement</strong></h3><br>Before any tenancy begins you will sign a Tenancy Agreement setting out the landlord's and tenant's obligations. A charge of £250 is made for the preparation of the<br>original Agreement and a further £100 for any extension Agreement(s) subsequently entered into. Once the Tenancy Agreement has been executed by you and the<br>landlord it is binding. Should your circumstances changes and the tenancy agreement need amending at any point during the tenancy you must inform us and, subject to your landlord's agreement (which might include the need to take up new references) we will prepare new documents for signature. Our fee for this will be £300 plus any applicable referencing.<br><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong><br>Security deposit</strong></h3><br>Before your tenancy commences you will be required to pay a security deposit which will be a minimum of one month's rent.
